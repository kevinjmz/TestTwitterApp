# TestTwitterApp
This app lets the user log in to any Twitter account, uses android speech recognition by Google to recognize what the user tells and tweets it.

This app utilizes two API's -- Twitter REST API-- and --Google Speech Recognition API--. 

HOW IT WORKS:
1.-The app either recognizes a previously authenticated Twitter and goes straight to the main activity 
OR
authenticates the user according to a previously created Twitter account.
